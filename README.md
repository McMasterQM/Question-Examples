# Examples of Questions with GitHub Classroom

With GitHub Classroom we can support both code-based and answer-based formats. This repository is a demonstration of answer-based format.

Complete the m_choice.ipynb notebook, using the example odd-numbered questions to learn the format for the even-numbered questions. A html view of the notebook can be found on the [course web site](https://qchem.qc-edu.org/ipynb/IntroTestExample.html).
